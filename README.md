📊 Loan Approval Prediction using Decision Tree (Google Colab)
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict loan approval status based on applicant and financial features.
The model is trained and evaluated in Google Colab using a realistic loan approval dataset.
The goal is to:
Preprocess real-world loan data
Train a Decision Tree model
Achieve a high accuracy score
Evaluate model performance
